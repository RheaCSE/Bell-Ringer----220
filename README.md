Verse]
Countin' up digits, pushin' them switches
One to the system, zeros in stitches
Bits flip like acrobats, code never glitches
Data stream flowin', uploadin' riches

[Verse 2]
From decimal to binary, numbers turn legendary
Machine language spoke since secondary
Zeros and ones, make the tech contemporary
Stackin' those digits, my hustle hereditary

[Chorus]
I I, double ones on the scene
O O, zeros clean like a dream
I O, binary code in the beam
I I, digits high like a scheme

[Verse 3]
Digits don't sleep, keep the LEDs buzzin'
Computin' beats, no need for discussin'
Zeros and ones, data never bluffin'
Conversion complete, got the numbers crushin'

[Verse 4]
RAM to the gig, binary wild
CPU grindin', programs compiled
Tech game's strong, circuits runnin' miles
Zeros and ones, got the firmware dialed

[Chorus]
I I, double ones on the scene
O O, zeros clean like a dream
I O, binary code in the beam
I I, digits high like a scheme
